# HivePlayerData
AutoHotKey program to display player statistics and other from the old HiveMC java server.

This repo is just for archiving purposes, the program will never work (unless edited to use HiveMC's Bedrock API).


# What it actually is

It's a set of GUIs that works with HiveMC's (now closed) REST API, using the JSON library.
