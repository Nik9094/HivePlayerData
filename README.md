# HivePlayerData
AutoHotKey program to display player statistics and other from the old HiveMC java server.
Among all the discord bots and websites, this was meant to be a low-weight and fast-loading program, since it uses almost no bandwidth (good for users with slow internet).

This repo is just for archiving purposes, the program will never work (unless edited to use HiveMC's Bedrock API).


# What it actually is

It's a set of GUIs that works with HiveMC's (now closed) REST API, using the JSON library.
